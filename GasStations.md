# Gas Stations
There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i]. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank, and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
Given two integer arrays of gas and cost, return the starting gas stationâ€™s index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.
\
* Input: [] gas and [] cost
 * Output: fuelForNextStation > gas[i] - cost[i]
 * fuelForNextStation = fuelForNextStation + gas[i] - cost[i]
 * Like start with 0 gas I put 2 of gas and the cost for next station is < that my gas I go fot next station
 * Pseudo Code
 * start = 0 gas
 * totalTrip = 0
 * fuelForTrip = 0
 * fuelForTrip = fuelForTrip + gas[i] - cost[i]
 * if(fuelForTrip <= cost){}
